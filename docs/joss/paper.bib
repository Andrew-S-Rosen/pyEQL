  abstract = {The Joint Expert Speciation System (JESS) is presently the world’s largest single source of thermodynamic information about aqueous electrolyte solutions. Comprehensive and upto-date thermodynamic models undoubtedly require such large databases but size alone, without well-designed data structures and good data assessment procedures, is insufficient. Computer databases are not like tables in a book; they should be constantly evolving, easy to search and specifically designed for processing by large-scale, automated facilities, including tests for careless errors and internal consistency. The maxim ‘garbage in, garbage out’ is today even more relevant than ever: without expert analysis and critical judgement, limitless storage capacity and computational power are likely just to add confusion rather than achieve meaningful insights into chemical problems. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the application of new methodologies to problems of differing size and complexity including harmonization of aqueous reaction equilibrium constants for more than 50,000 chemical species, systematic critical assessment of the thermophysical properties of aqueous glycine and its solid–liquid equilibria over wide ranges of temperature and pressure, and development of standalone programs for users lacking training in chemical speciation problems. Extension of these methods to new applications is discussed.},

  abstract = {A large, open-access, sustainable database of relative Gibbs energies is developed for over 50\,000 aqueous chemical species, including many metal–ligand complexes.           ,              Spanning all available combinations of more than 50\,000 chemical species pertinent to aqueous solutions at 25 °C, a comprehensive set of reliable, thermodynamically-consistent standard Gibbs energies of reaction and their corresponding equilibrium constants is derived. The number and type of species that can be assessed for consistency is greatly expanded by abandoning conventional use of the chemical elements as the basis set. Using reaction data previously accumulated from the literature for almost 80\,000 chemical reactions, equilibrium constants are automatically obtained (by extrapolation to standard conditions as necessary) and brought into thermodynamic consistency by a large-scale ordered Gaussian elimination process, yielding over 2500 basis species and the relative standard Gibbs energies for all other chemical species in known equilibrium with them. This allows the Gibbs energy difference for any relevant reaction to be calculated by summation. Strategies have been developed to ensure the process is dependable, scalable and sustainable. A new hazard with the averaging of thermodynamic parameters is identified. The results, which are openly available on-line, are in good accord with authoritative sources such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Thermodynamic Web-book and the Chemical Thermodynamics Series from the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) but are far more extensive, including for the first time many analytical chelating agents and their metal complexes.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of the binary aqueous solutions of 183 electrolytes at 25 °C and 1 bar have been fitted using a standard form of the Pitzer equations. Where possible, all thermodynamic properties have been treated simultaneously, in contrast to previous compilations of Pitzer parameters. Prior to fitting, a critical assessment of the available information for each system was made using the JESS database and software. Employing linear regression with singular value decomposition and using an appropriate objective function criterion, more than two-thirds of the systems could be satisfactorily fitted to the upper concentration limit of the available data. Only six electrolytes proved to be completely intractable using the present Pitzer model. All of these systems (which included HF, H2SO4, and H3PO4) are known to exhibit significant changes in chemical speciation at low concentrations (even though ion association per se does not preclude a satisfactory fit). The present Pitzer ion-interaction parameters provide a coherent, up-to-date set of empirical coefficients that can be combined in a self-consistent manner to produce multicomponent electrolyte solution models having a minimum of computational uncertainty in bulk solution properties such as density, heat capacity, and water activity.},
