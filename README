pyEQL: A Python library for solution chemistry
==============================================

## test change for master branch

pyEQL is a python library that provides tools for chemical equilibrium modeling 
in aqueous solutions. It allows the user to manipulate solutions as Python
objects, providing methods to populate them with solutes, calculate 
species-specific properties (such as activity coefficients), and retreive bulk 
properties (such as density, conductivity, or volume).

It aspires to provide flexibilty, transparency, extensibility, and robust 
features. It is designed to be customizable and easy to integrate into projects 
that require chemical modeling.

Design Principles
-----------------

- Problems can be set up and executed with minimal user input, if desired. Use 
  of pyEQL is scaleable from minimal input (in which pyEQL inserts reasonable 
  assumptions) to very detailed input, depending on the needs of the user.

- Sufficient details regarding assumptions, limitations, or qualifications to 
  any calculation executed by pyEQL should be logged to help the researcher  
  understand the limitations of pyEQL's output. pyEQL should throw warnings 
  and/or errors when calculations exceed the valid limits of an equation or 
  paramter.

- Detailed information about all parameter values supplied from the pyEQL 
  database should be readily accessible to the user, including units, the 
  conditions of measurement, and literature reference.

Key Features
------------

- Build accurate solution properties using a minimum of inputs. Just specify
  the identity and quantity of a solute and pyEQL will do the rest.
  
- "Graceful Decay" from more sophisticated, data-intensive modeling approaches 
  to simpler, less accurate ones depending on the amount of data supplied. 

- Not limited to dilute solutions. pyEQL contains out of the box support for 
  the Pitzer Model and other methods for modeling concentrated solutions.
  
- Extensible database system that facilitates integrating supplemental 
  parameter values with pyEQL's defaults.

- Units-aware calculations (by means of the pint library)
  
- Logging system provides robust documentation of data sources, assumptions, 
  and limitations of all calculations
